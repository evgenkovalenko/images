Running a .NET Solution Locally with Docker using Docker Compose

1Ô∏è.	Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker Desktop for Windows
- Docker Compose

2.	Running the Solution

Start the environment using:

Open powershell and run next command:

 docker compose  -f "{Full-path-to-folder-with code}\docker-compose.yml" -f "{Full-path-to-folder-with code}\docker-compose.override.yml" -p ekovalenkocompose103 --ansi never up -d --build --remove-orphans
 
After that in Docker Desktop must be created next containers

3. Testing the Application
Once the containers are up, you can check if your application is running correctly by making a POST request:

CMD :
curl -X POST http://localhost:25331/match -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"UserId\":\"userid_1\"}"

For Matchmaking.Service application port 25331 was set in docker-compose.yml configuration, so it will be static.


To retreive match information can be used browser, postman

OR CMD

curl -X GET "http://localhost:25331/match?userId=userid_1" -H "Accept: application/json"


4. To check application logs can be used Docker Desktop functionality :
